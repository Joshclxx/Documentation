                In this modern day that uses technology as a tool to improve our
                businesses, such as fast-food chains and other small businesses
                and retail that need manpower to build, they benefit from
                automated systems that enhance efficiency, accuracy, and
                customer service.
              </p>
              <p>
                The system we created is called the Point-of-Sale system, which
                is specifically designed for a coffee shop to address the need
                for an organized and reliable digital management solution. It is
                equipped with a complete set of features, starting from a secure
                log-in system to ensure that only authorized personnel can
                access the platform. The system has three primary interfaces:
                the admin, manager, and cashier interfaces.
              </p>
              <p>
                Each interface is designed for a certain user role. Sales
                tracking, inventory checks, and order processing are among the
                fundamental functions supported by the staff interface. Tools
                for monitoring employee performance, checking daily reports, and
                responding to client feedback are available through the
                management interface.
              </p>
              <p>
                The highest level of access is available through the admin
                interface, which enables the administrator to modify system
                settings, manage user accounts, and use analytics to produce
                business insights. Through the integration of these features
                into a single, integrated system, the platform seeks to enhance
                customer service, reduce manual errors, and optimize workflow.
                Based on up-to-date information, it guarantees that management
                can make data-driven decisions.
              </p>
              <p>
                Overall, this approach helps the coffee shop&apos;s long-term
                growth and success in addition to improving the effectiveness of
                everyday operations.
